
Things I did:

1. Importing ERC721 contracts
2. Storing the image/Media file into IPFS server and getting the link for that
3. Creating the JSON file containing the metadata of the digital art also containing the IPFS link.
4. Writing and deploying a smart contract containing the mint function(ERC 721) which takes in URI of the JSON file and deploys on the blockchain
5. Creating a webapp and using web3js to connect website to blockchain to interact with the smart contract on the blockchain.
